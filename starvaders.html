									<h3>Summary</h3>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Context:</b> Star★Vaders is a game expected to hit Steam Early Access in Q4 2023. I performed a usability evaluation to help the development team identify UX issues so that they can improve their game prior to broader release.</li>
										<li><b>Approach:</b> I followed the <a href="https://gamesuserresearch.com/how-to-get-games-user-research-experience-before-you-have-a-job/">steps</a> provided by Steve Bromley because he seems knowledgeable about how to break into the industry.</li>
										<li><b>Outcome:</b> Some of the feedback has been addressed in the latest version of the game (not yet in Early Access) with more changes on the way. One of my notable learnings was that for games where a core element revolves around randomness (Ex: rogue-likes), as a reviewer you need to account for and manage that randomness. In this case, I took a time bound brute force approach.</li>

									<h3>Context</h3>
									<p>The goal of this review was to identify any potential usability issues so that they can be resolved and help educate the team on usability so that they can design with usability in mind.  StarVaders is a game targeting Steam Early Access in Q4 2023.</p>
									<hr />
									<h3>Approach</h3>
									<h4>Overall</h4>
									<p>I followed the <a href="https://gamesuserresearch.com/how-to-get-games-user-research-experience-before-you-have-a-job/">blueprint</a> outlined by Steve Bromley. I did this because he is a seasoned games user researcher and wrote a book on how to be a games user researcher which is what I’d like to be.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Identify suitable game – I found this game on one of the playtesting subreddits and it fit all the criteria (still time to make changes to the game, small team that does not have dedicated UX support, a mix of genres I am familiar with, etc) </li>
										<li>Reach out – I contacted the development team via their Discord which was on their subreddit post.  In discussions with them, it sounded like it would be a good partnership as they were open to user experience feedback and are serious about game development.</li>
										<li>Define scope and context – Continued discussion with developer to understand their current focus, priorities, timeline, etc so that I could better tailor the review to fit their needs.</li>
										<li>Conduct Review – I played through the game as a normal player recording my gameplay footage as well as taking notes in a blank mind map. I did this to capture the new player experience.  Then I played the game as a UX professional to evaluate all aspects of the game through a UX lens.  For any potential issues that I captured I would have additional play sessions to validate.  </li>
										<li>Report – I organized all my findings into a report.  The results were grouped by priority.  After I completed my draft, I reached out to the IGDA Games Research and User Experience SIG for peer review and received some feedback from several folks in the community including <a href="https://www.stevebromley.com/blog/about/">Steve Bromley</a>.  I updated my report to address the feedback.</li>
									</ol>
									
									<hr />
									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									<p>I shared my report with my developer contact and we had a dialogue about the material.  The developer completely agreed with my findings.  Some findings have now been addressed via an improved tutorial, visual explanations for in game abilities, and navigation buttons.</p>
									<p>One of my own learnings was the challenging nature of testing rogue-like games.  Due to their inherent randomness, without special testing capabilities, a reviewer may have a difficult time trying to review all scenarios.  For this study, I time bound the exercise and during that time period I tried to hit as many possible scenarios. I was thorough as I did not encounter any new scenarios after a while during my testing. However, it is possible that some edge case scenarios were missed.</p>
									<p>As part of this activity, I also requested feedback on the report and process so that I can improve this experience moving forward.  This is an excerpt from what the developer shared:</p>
									<blockquote>My feedback for you and your report is overall perfect. All the issues you've brought up are real issues that I totally agree with, and would be helpful for us to fix.  
										<br> <br>You also display a very good understanding of the game for your limited playtime, and understand the intricacies of expected and unexpected behavior. (Calling out the Mothership, the turn timer, pushing invaders out of the doom zone, etc, are all very advanced topics that I was pleasantly surprised to see commented on!)</blockquote>
